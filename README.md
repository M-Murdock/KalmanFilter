`main.py` contains the code implementations for each homework problem (with the exception of Question 1.4 -- see below). To run each implementation, simply uncomment the corresponding function call within the main() function. For example, to run the implementation for Problem 2.3, uncomment the function `two_point_three()`. 

`covariance_ellipse.py` generates a graph of the uncertainty ellipse for Question 1.4. 

`World.py` and `Kalman.py` are supporting classes which simulate the drone's ground truth position/velocity and Kalman Filter, respectively.
